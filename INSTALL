Note: WDRBD9 (DRBD for Windows) is at a very early development stage, 
so please don't expect everything described in here to work out-of-the-box.

Furthermore, running WDRBD9 will, at some point, most likely crash your 
windows machine (blue screen) so be sure to
	1.) Not use it on production machines.
	2.) Make Snapshots frequently.

In particular, make a snapshot every time before you execute the
INSTALL-DRBD-admin.bat script, since after that your Windows box
will not boot any more.

Build environment setup:

You need two virtual machines: 
	1.) One Linux box with spatch installed (in addition to 
		the usual development tools like make, gcc, ...)
		On Ubuntu this is installed by:

			sudo apt-get install coccinelle

	2.) A Windows 7 WM with Service Pack 1 (at least) installed.
		This is what we currently use for development.

	    Download and install the EWDK as described in:

		https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/installing-the-enterprise-wdk

	   	Install it to 
			C:\ewdk 
		This saves you from too many makefile edits later

	    Download and Install cygwin 
	    Download and Install Development tools of cygwin (there is
		a GUI for that, please don't expect screenshots in here)

	    Note: I've also installed Visual Studio on my Windows box,
		not sure if that is needed also, since the C compiler
		should come with ewdk.

git clone wdrbd with:

bash$ git clone --recursive http://git.drbd.org/wdrbd.git	

on your Linux box. wdrbd uses drbd as a submodule that's why --recursive
is needed.

Share the wdrbd9 folder via Samba, so that your Windows VM can access it
(we are not keeping any important data on the Windows VM since it will
crash frequently). You can use the GNOME Files utility to do so (for
example).

Mount the shared folder in your windows box:
	net use z: \\<ip-of-linux-box>\wdrbd9
(assuming the share name is wdrbd9)

Building and "insmod" DRBD windows driver:

        1.) Run
                make
        on the Linux box (from $HOME/Linbit/Work/wdrbd9)

        2.) Run
                make
        on the Windows box (from $HOME/Linbit/Work/wdrbd9 (takes some while)

        3.) Run
                make install
        on the Windows box (from $HOME/Linbit/Work/wdrbd9/converted-sources/drbd)

        4.) Run (in an Administrator cmd.exe Console: to open it go to
                 C:\Windows\System32 in Explorer, Cmd-Click on cmd.exe
                 and select Run as Administrator)
                INSTALL-DRBD-admin.bat
	from within C:\cygwin64\tmp\drbd (or whereever make install
	told you to do so).

        5.) To load the driver, do (from Adminstrator Console)
                sc start drbd
        DbgViewer will show output. To start DbgViewer go to
        C:\drbd\DebugViewer and start DbgView.exe as Administrator

------------

Note on logging: Currently the IP of the syslog host is hardcoded into the
source (somewhere near win4lin/src/printk-to-syslog.c:37) in hexadecimal
*and* network byte order. In order to see log messages you need to change
that (and follow the instructions there to enable syslog UDP logging).
Since it is only IPv4 addresses I assume you can compute it in your 
head ;) 

You can also use the dbgview.exe tool (please google it) and enable 
Capture Kernel on Windows to see some log messages. It must be run as
Administrator on the Windows machine.

--------------

Note on crypto: Even though I start Windows with driver signature verification
off it still needs to be signed. The crypto directory, for obvious reasons
doesn't contain our (Linbit) keys so you have to create your own. Please
consult google and/or then enclosed README about how to do this.

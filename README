** DRBD for Windows **

These are scripts to convert a Linux-DRBD-9 codebase to Windows-compatible 
files that can be compiled via CL.EXE.


You'll need the EWDK 10[1] (the "Enterprise Windows Driver Kit"),
respectively at least the part adressed as
	ewdk/Program Files/Windows Kits/10/Include,
and the matching Visual C compiler ("CL.EXE") and associated
build tools (like "MSBUILD.EXE").


You'll need either a Linux machine or enough of the Cygwin tools to run the 
conversion; so for example "make", "perl", "sed", "awk", "cp", "rm".


After the sources have been converted, the Makefile will try to run MSBUILD;
if it fails to do so, you will need to run it in the "converted-sources" 
directory yourself.

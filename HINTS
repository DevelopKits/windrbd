If Cygwin is already installed on the computer (or installed later)
rename the cygwin1.dll in C:\Windows\System32 to cygwin1-old.dll .
This has to be redone for now  whenever a new version of 
windrbd is installed.

If accessing the windrbd device's drive fails with Invalid request code
this is most likely because the device is not primary. Do a

	drbdadm primary <res>

to make it primary.

Run install-windrbd-signed.exe as administrator else it
will complain about some file not found.

Find the windrbd config files under C:\windrbd\etc
C:\windrbd is the root of a Linux like directory tree, which
should contain all files and directories needed by the
userland admin tools (drbdadm, drbdsetup, ...).

To create a new resource, you can start from the
C:\windrbd\etc\drbd.d\w0.res file which contains
documentation about differences between Linux DRBD
and windrbd resources.

The userland admin tools should behave just the same way as
their Linux counterparts.

A new tool is windrbd.exe, use it:

 * To see log messages written by the kernel driver:

	windrbd log-server [filename]

   If filename is specified, log messages are also written
   to the file named filename.

 * To prepare an existing NTFS partition for use with
   windrbd:

         windrbd hide-filesystem <drive-letter>

   Windrbd prevents Windows from accessing a backing device by
   patching the first sector of the device. The above command
   will do this. If you want to use the device without windrbd
   again you can do a

         windrbd show-filesystem <drive-letter>

   Note that when you format a windrbd device patching to and
   from the backing device happens automatically, you only need
   the windrbd utility if you have existing partitions which you
   want to use as windrbd backing devices.

For other features just call it without parameters.

Don't forget to disable Windows firewall or even better, open
the configured windrbd TCP/IP ports for incoming connections.

If accessing the windrbd device's drive fails with Invalid request code
this is most likely because the device is not primary. Do a

	drbdadm primary <res>

to make it primary.

Flush buffers is currently not yet implemented.

When becoming secondary (was primary before), read requests are
still served from Windows read cache (with outdated data). This
will change soon (all read requests from secondary will fail,
then).

Right now, drive letter of windrbd device (the device you use
to access data) is hardcoded to 'C'+minor, so for example
/dev/drbd5 would match /dev/drbd5. This will change in the
near future. (windrbd.exe utility already can assign drive
letters, but drbdadm can't).

Userland callbacks are not implemented at the moment.
